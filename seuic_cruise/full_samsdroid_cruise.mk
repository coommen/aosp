# This is a build configuration for a full-featured build of the
# Open-Source part of the tree. It's geared toward a US-centric
# build of the emulator, but all those aspects can be overridden
# in inherited configurations.

# Inheriting from aosp_base.mk would define most of the needed base configurations
# aosp_base.mk has the following inheritance tree:
#     +--> ful_base.mk
#     +--> generic_no_telephony.mk
#     +--> core.mk
#     +--> core_base.mk
#     +--> core_minimal.mk
#     +--> base.mk
#     +--> embedded.mk

# Didn't load in Emulator
#$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base.mk)

#using this instead
$(call inherit-product, device/generic/armv7-a-neon/mini_common.mk)


# REQUIRED - creates the emulator tools for the build
# must be included in the product make file in order to get it created for this product
